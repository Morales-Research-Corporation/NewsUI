# NewsUI v1.0
The NewsUI is a open-source interface and framework for news apps that would like to have a sleek but vintage newspaper interface!
Warning, the interface is writen in Swift/Playground

This user interface/experience is used in our app called GEO which bring the top news of this week in a brief and simple view

NewsUI v2.0 ---> Will include a few minor improvements
